### This updates with new canadian internships every 24 hours

Fun little project using Node.js and Express. It scrapes this page 👉 https://github.com/SimplifyJobs/Summer2025-Internships and takes the internships that are canadian. It saves them into json format, then before the data is sent to the HTML frontend for display, the data is cleaned using JavaScript. 

Pretty cool 😁
